# Introduction

This project is no longer under development. See my more recent `nba` repo
for my current efforts on this subject.

This project (beginning around the time of my graduation from college in May 2016) was my first real dive into experimenting with machine learning models.
I initiated this project as a means of re-inforcing the concept that
I had learned in the
*Introduction to Statistical Learning with R (ISLR)* book.
After developing some scripts to scrape data from websites like
(<https://www.basketball-reference.com>), 
I tried out various classification and linear regression techniques
to predict season win totals for NBA teams.

The primary deliverables of this projects are the `classification.R` and `linear_regression.R` scripts in the `R` folder. Both are formatted such that they can be converted directly to a .html or .pdf file
(using the `rmarkdown::render()` function). This was done with `classification.R`. (See the
`output` folder). On the other hand, the `linear_regression.R` script was never fully completed.

# Notes to Self

This project was **heavily** restuctured when cleaning it up for GitHub.
(Actually two projects were combined into one to create this one.)
The code that is in this repo cannot be expected to run properly without
some revising.

Also, this project was my first ever project with R programming, so the
coding style is probably something that should be emulated.
